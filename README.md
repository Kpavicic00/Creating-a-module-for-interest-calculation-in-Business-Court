Large business information systems have always been an integral part of the structure of
every basic institution, whether in the public or private sector. Regardless of the advancement
and development of technology, large business information systems are the only systems that
can guarantee the high security of private data, the quality of services such as transactions and
the like, performance, implementation of various legal norms, their consistent application and
storage, and the storage of huge amounts of data. It can be said that, as such, it was the only
one that could and will guarantee high safety criteria in the future. As such, it is used in the
public sector such as hospitals, higher education institutions, administrative institutions, banks
and other private companies with similar requirements. Java has always been, because of its
characteristics, the basic programming language of large systems, while C / C ++ is mainly
used as part of a system implementation for input data or special driver programs due to its
proximity to the machine language. As such, the goal of this application, which portrays a
small part of the functionality of a business system, was to highlight and highlight the features
and benefits that, despite the rapid development of technology, large business information
systems remained in use. The calculation of the interest calculation module in the
enforcement procedure is a functionality whose main task is to pay FINA in advance, that is,
at the very beginning of reporting the foreclosure process. In this way, FINA will charge,
regardless of whether the foreclosure is payable or not, thus avoiding the possibility of FINA
leaving out of commission for the particular service provided.
